Two types of plants exist: bush (determinate) and vining (indeterminate).','Plant in well-prepared soil with lots of compost, lava sand, rock phosphate, and organic fertilizer. In sandy soil, add high-calcium lime. In alkaline soil, add Texas greensand. For transplants, use the following schedule: plant after all danger of frost in the spring and 12-14 weeks before the first average frost in the fall. Plant transplants by laying the plant down sideways or planting deeply. Tomatoes are able to root from the stems. The sideways method is best in heavier clay soils. If you start your tomatoes from seed, here''s the plan. Plant the seeds indoors in organic potting soil, 1/4"—V£" deep, in a well-lit or greenhouse condition. They will germinate in 5-14 days at about 68°-85°. Keep the seedlings cool and in bright light to keep them from getting spindly. HARVEST Harvest in summer when the fruit starts to ripen and turn red, usually 55-90 days after planting. Picking the tomatoes as the color first starts to change will help prevent birds, squirrels, and other critters from eating the fruit before you get it, and the fruit will continue to ripen indoors.

Others have straight flower shoots, and some have no flowers at all. Flat, straplike, gray-green leaves, underground bulbs with many cloves.','Plant cloves in the fall. Purchase big, healthy bulbs (organically grown if possible) and break them apart into cloves. Each clove should be planted 3"4" apart and about 1" deep in clay soils, 2" deep in sandy soils. It''s best to place the pointed end up, although garlic seems to grow fine if the cloves are sideways. After planting the cloves, cover the planting area with about 2" of mulch. A little frost burn to the foliage tips is normal. During hard freezes, the plants can be covered with hay or floating row cover for protection, but that''s usually unnecessary. For larger bulbs, cut off the flowering stems as they emerge from the foliage. HARVEST When the tips of the leaves first begin to turn yellow in early summer, the bulbs are ready for harvest. Don''t wait until the entire top is brown; energy and food value is used up as the foliage deteriorates. Dig out gently with a turning fork. Cut the tops off or tie or braid them and hang in the garage or a partially shaded place to dry. Store in a cool, dry area. Use your garlic freely, but save some of the larger bulbs for the next year''s planting.','Garlic leaves and cloves are great for eating and for seasoning vegetables, meats, sauces, gravies, soups, and just about anything else. Try the young leaves in scrambled eggs and garlic powder on most any meat dish. Garlic is taken for the prevention and treatment of colds and bronchitis. It is also said to help in treating lead poisoning, normalizing blood pressure, killing bacteria (it''s a natural antibiotic), and detoxifying blood. It''s a beautiful ornamental plant or a nice addition to mass plantings or interspersed in the perennial or rose garden. Deters many insect pests. Spraying with garlic tea works as well as toxic chemicals in getting rid of flying adult mosquitoes. Garlic tea sprayed on plant foliage prior to heavy insect infestations works as a powerful repellent to most problem insects and many diseases. Significant fungicidal powers.','Few if any except occasional slug nibbles. Overwatering can rot the bulbs.','Garlic is one of the world''s most health-giving foods, an important medicinal herb, a key ingredient in homemade insect spray, and a good-looking landscape plant. Giant garlic, or elephant garlic (A. scorodoprasuni), has a milder flavor than true garlic and produces a fist-size bulb. It is actually a leek, but its culture is the same.
